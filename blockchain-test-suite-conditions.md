Of course. This is an excellent idea. A final compliance checklist is the perfect way to validate that the implementation matches the architectural blueprint we so carefully designed.

Here is a comprehensive checklist, broken down by the core components of our vision. It's written as a series of verifiable questions that can be answered by inspecting the code.

APStatChain Final Compliance Checklist
Part 1: Core Logic & Consensus (packages/chain-core)

This section verifies that the fundamental rules of the blockchain are correctly implemented.

[ ] C1. Transaction Structure: Does the Transaction interface in types.ts include detailed payload information (like videoId, itemType) as specified, not just a point value?

[ ] C2. Block Structure: Does the Block interface in types.ts include an attestations array (to store peer signatures) and does the BlockHeader include a proofOfAccessHash?

[ ] C3. Proof of Access Logic: Does the consensus.ts module contain a function (selectPuzzleForUser or similar) that correctly identifies a user's most recent progress and uses that transaction's hash as proofOfAccess for proposing a new block?

[ ] C4. Puzzle Verification: Does the validation.ts or consensus.ts module contain a function that can validate a block's puzzle solution (nonce) against the QuizBank.ts data, based on the lesson proven in the proofOfAccessHash?

[ ] C5. Attestation Requirement (Validation): Does the master isBlockValid function check that the block.attestations array contains at least 5 unique, valid signatures? (Note: The logic to collect these signatures is in the P2P layer, but the rule to check them lives here).

[ ] C6. Penalty Box (Database): Does the database.ts file's Dexie.js schema define a penaltyBox table with fields for publicKey, scoreMultiplier, and expiryTimestamp?

[ ] C7. Penalty Box (Logic): Is there a function (handleFailedBlock or similar) that correctly writes to the penaltyBox and returns transactions to the mempool when a block proposal fails validation?

Part 2: Peer-to-Peer Networking (packages/chain-p2p)

This section verifies that the nodes can communicate and cooperate according to our protocol.

[ ] P1. Peer Discovery: Does the bootstrap.ts module correctly query a DNS Seed URL to find initial peers?

[ ] P2. Protocol Version Handshake: When two peers connect, does the node.ts logic exchange a HELLO message containing a protocolVersion? Does it correctly flag peers with a mismatched version as incompatible for block/transaction exchange?

[ ] P3. Candidate Block Gossip: Does the P2PNode class have a method to broadcast an ANNOUNCE_CANDIDATE_BLOCK message to all connected, compatible peers?

[ ] P4. Attestation Gossip: Does the P2PNode class have logic to broadcast a SEND_ATTESTATION message after it successfully validates a candidate block from another peer?

[ ] P5. Passive Conflict Resolution: Is the logic in place for a node to abandon its own block proposal if it receives a valid, competing candidate block from a peer before its own is finalized?

[ ] P6. Missing Transaction Request: Does the message protocol in protocol.ts define a GET_MISSING_TX message type? Is there logic in node.ts to request a missing transaction when validating a block from a peer?

Part 3: Application Integration & UI (apps/web)

This section verifies that the user experience correctly reflects the underlying blockchain's state.

[ ] A1. Central Service: Is there a BlockchainService.ts that acts as the single point of contact between the UI and the blockchain packages (chain-core, chain-p2p)?

[ ] A2. Reactive State Provider: Is a BlockchainProvider.tsx (React Context) used to supply live blockchain data (like syncStatus, leaderboardData, peerCount) to the UI components?

[ ] A3. Proactive Mining Puzzle: Is the MiningPuzzleModal triggered for a user proactively when their action causes the conditions for block creation (10 txs / 1 hour) to be met?

[ ] A4. Submitting Progress: When a user completes a lesson item, does the application call a service method (e.g., submitLessonProgress) that correctly creates, signs, and broadcasts a LESSON_PROGRESS transaction to the network?

[ ] A5. Stale Data Indication: Does the UI clearly indicate when its displayed data is "stale" and that a sync is in progress (e.g., a "Syncing... X blocks remaining" message)?

[ ] A6. New User Snapshot: Does the BlockchainService logic include a step for new users to download a "Trusted Snapshot" to avoid a full historical sync?

Part 4: Governance & Security

This section verifies the implementation of the "benevolent dictator" and recovery mechanisms.

[ ] G1. Teacher's Key for Recovery: Is there a transaction type RECOVER_KEY? Does the validation logic for this transaction type require that it be signed by a hardcoded Teacher's master public key?

[ ] G2. Teacher's Key for Upgrades: Is there a P2P message type PROTOCOL_UPGRADE? Does the logic that handles this message verify that it is signed by the Teacher's master key before taking action?

[ ] G3. Master Key Storage (Conceptual): Has the Teacher's master private key been completely removed from the application source code and stored securely offline? (This is a conceptual check, not a code check).
