Phase 3.1: Package Scaffolding & Initial Setup
Goal: To create the folder structure and install the dependencies for our new networking package.
Key Actions:
Create the Package Directory: Inside the /packages directory, create a new folder named chain-p2p.
Initialize package.json: Create a package.json file inside chain-p2p.
Define the package name (e.g., @apstatchain/p2p).
Add @apstatchain/core as a local workspace dependency.
Mark it as a module ("type": "module").
Install Dependencies: From the project root, install the required library into the chain-p2p workspace.
peerjs: The core library for WebRTC peer-to-peer connections.
Create Empty Source Files: Create the initial empty source files inside packages/chain-p2p/src/:
protocol.ts
bootstrap.ts
node.ts
Expected Outcome: A packages/chain-p2p folder that is correctly configured as part of the monorepo. It should be ableto import types and functions from @apstatchain/core without issue.
