Phase 3.3: Implementing Peer Discovery
Goal: To implement the logic for finding initial peers using our DNS Seed strategy.
Key Actions:
Open the File: packages/chain-p2p/src/bootstrap.ts.
Define Constants: At the top of the file, define a const array of DNS_SEED_URLS. For now, we can use a placeholder or a free DNS-over-HTTPS provider like Cloudflare.
const DNS_SEED_URLS = ['https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=seed.apstatchain.com&type=TXT'];
Implement discoverPeers function:
Signature: export async function discoverPeers(): Promise<string[]> (returns an array of peer IDs/IPs).
Logic:
The function will iterate through the DNS_SEED_URLS.
It will use the fetch API to make a GET request to each URL.
It will parse the JSON response to extract the list of peer addresses from the TXT record.
It will aggregate the results from all seeds, remove duplicates, and return the final list.
Wrap the logic in a try...catch block to handle network errors gracefully.
Expected Outcome: A bootstrap.ts module with a single function that can successfully query a DNS record and return a list of peer addresses.
