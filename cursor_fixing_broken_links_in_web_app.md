# Fixing broken links in web app

**User**

This web app lives at@index.html ..

Works alright, but I noticed that when I click on a quiz link.. it is broken, there is no pdf at the other end.. nothing to download!
Please take a look at my project structure and help me find how to fix all the broken links?  The links themselves arent broken in @allUnitsData.js which has most of the curriculum material.

Somehow it's getting twisted by the time it is being served in the website.

Don't code anything I just want your ability to look through my project for context, to make a multiphase plan of action to fix all this.

Just a word of note, if you nee dto run node, PATH hasn't been set properly so use@run.bat beforehand.

Below is a high-level troubleshooting & remediation roadmap (no code yet) that walks from diagnosis → durable fix → long-term safeguards.  
It assumes you will run all front-end work from the `apps/web` package (React + Vite) and that PDFs must be reachable both in dev (`vite dev`) and in a static production deploy (e.g. Vercel).

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 0 Quick test to prove the bug
1. Start the dev server:
   > `cd apps/web && npm run dev`  (or use `run.bat npm run dev`)
2. Browse to a lesson page that contains a quiz.
3. Inspect the network tab when you click “📄 Questions” or “📄 Answers”.
   • You will see 404s hitting URLs like  
     `/unit/unit1/lesson/1-2/pdfs/unit1/...`  

   This shows the link is treated as *relative* to the current route, not the site root, and Vite is not serving anything called `/pdfs`.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 1 Determine the two root causes  

A. URL construction
   • In `LessonPage.tsx` the anchor `href={quiz.questionPdf}` receives whatever string is stored in the data file.  
   • In `js/allUnitsData.js` every `questionPdf` / `answersPdf` is written as `"pdfs/unitX/..."` (no leading slash).  
   • When React Router renders `/unit/.../lesson/...`, a browser treats that as a *relative* path and prepends the current directory → wrong URL.

B. Asset serving
   • Even if you add the leading “/”, Vite only serves static files that live in `apps/web/public` (or are imported/hashed through the bundle).  
   • Your actual `pdfs/` directory sits at repo-root, outside of `apps/web`. So `/pdfs/...` 404s in dev & prod.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 Choose the fix strategy  

Option 1 (quick & clear)  
   • Keep the paths exactly as they are in the data file (no huge search-and-replace).  
   • At render time, force every link to be absolute:  
     `href={'/' + quiz.questionPdf.replace(/^\/?/, '')}`  

Option 2 (data-centric)  
   • Mass-update every PDF path in `js/allUnitsData.js` by prefixing “/”.  
   • No runtime logic needed after that.

Either way you must ALSO make the files reachable:

Asset-serve choices  
1. Copy / symlink the whole `pdfs/` tree into `apps/web/public` (easiest, works with Vite & static hosting).  
2. Or extend Vite config with `server.fs.allow` / custom middleware to expose the repo-root `pdfs` directory.  
3. Or serve PDFs through an API (e.g. `express.static`) if you already run a back-end; then transform the links to point at that endpoint.

Most teams pick #1: public folder copy.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3 Implement & verify

Step 3-A Asset availability  
   • Add a post-install or build-time script:  
     `cp -r ../../pdfs ./public/` inside `apps/web`.  
   • Commit (or ignore) the copied folder per your hosting plan.

Step 3-B Absolute URLs  
   Option 1: small helper in `LessonPage.tsx` (one-liner as above).  
   Option 2: one-time script to rewrite all PDF paths in `allUnitsData.js` (regex).

Step 3-C Manual QA  
   • Run `vite dev`, click several quiz links from nested routes → PDF opens.  
   • Build & preview production bundle (`npm run build && npm run preview`).  
   • Deploy a preview to Vercel/Netlify and spot-check again.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4 Automated safety nets

1. Unit test: in `src/__tests__/assetLinks.test.ts`
   • Iterate over `ALL_UNITS_DATA`, assert every `questionPdf` & `answersPdf` starts with `/pdfs/`.

2. E2E test with Playwright (you already have `e2e/`):
   • Navigate to a representative lesson, click first quiz link, expect HTTP 200 and `Content-Type: application/pdf`.

3. CI check: fail build if the copy script detects missing PDFs or if the path test fails.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5 House-keeping & documentation

• Add a paragraph in `apps/web/README.md` explaining where static curriculum assets live and how they’re copied.  
• Consider moving *all* static, version-controlled assets (PDFs, example datasets, etc.) into a single mono-repo directory (`/assets`) and symlink/public-copy from there.  
• If file size is a concern, you can host PDFs on an external object store (S3/GCS) and store only HTTPS URLs in `allUnitsData.js`; then you skip public folder issues entirely.

────────────────────────────────────────
Recap
Broken links stem from (1) relative URL building and (2) PDFs not inside Vite’s `public`. Fix either by making links absolute *and* ensuring the pdfs folder is copied/served inside `apps/web/public`. Once those two pipes are correctly connected, the curriculum links will download as expected.

Of course. Based on my analysis of your project's context, the problem is a classic case of how web servers and browsers handle file paths. The links in your data file are correct in isolation, but they break when used within the structure of your React/Vite application.

Here is a high-level troubleshooting and remediation roadmap. It walks from diagnosis to a durable fix and includes long-term safeguards, all without writing any code. It assumes you are running commands from the apps/web directory for the frontend application.

────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 1: Diagnosis & Root Cause Analysis

This phase confirms exactly why the links are failing.

Start the Dev Server:

Using your run.bat to set the environment, start the Vite development server:

run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev


Reproduce the Bug & Inspect:

Open the web app in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

Navigate to a lesson page that has a quiz, for example, Unit 1, Topic 1.2.

Open your browser's Developer Tools and switch to the Network tab.

Click the "📄 Questions" link for the quiz.

Analyze the 404 Error:

You will see a request in the network tab that fails with a 404 Not Found status.

The requested URL will look something like this:
/unit/unit1/lesson/1-2/pdfs/unit1/unit1_section1.2_quiz.pdf

This immediately reveals the two core problems:

A. Relative Path Resolution: Your allUnitsData.js file stores the link as "pdfs/unit1/...". Since it doesn't start with a /, the browser treats it as a path relative to the current page's URL (/unit/unit1/lesson/1-2/). The browser incorrectly prepends the current route to the link.

B. Asset Serving Location: Even if the path were correct (/pdfs/unit1/...), the Vite development server doesn't know about the pdfs folder. Vite only serves static files from the apps/web/public directory by default. Your pdfs folder lives at the project's root, outside of the web app's reach.

────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 2: Formulate a Fix Strategy

To fix this, we must solve both the pathing and the serving issues. You have choices for each.

Strategy for Pathing (Choose one):

Option A: Data-Centric Fix (Recommended for clarity)

Action: Systematically edit allUnitsData.js. Use a search-and-replace to prefix every questionPdf and answersPdf path with a leading slash (/).

Example: "pdfs/unit1/..." becomes "/pdfs/unit1/...".

Pro: The data itself is now unambiguously correct. The React code remains simple with no special logic.

Con: Requires a careful, one-time modification of a large data file.

Option B: Runtime Fix

Action: Leave allUnitsData.js as-is. Modify the React component that renders the link (likely a file like LessonPage.tsx or similar) to programmatically make the path absolute.

Example: Instead of href={quiz.questionPdf}, you would use href={'/' + quiz.questionPdf}.

Pro: No need to touch the large data file; the fix is localized to one component.

Con: Adds a small piece of logic that runs every time a link is rendered. It's slightly less direct than fixing the source data.

Strategy for Asset Serving (This is required regardless of the pathing choice):

Action: Make the pdfs directory available to the web app by copying it into the public folder. This is the standard and most robust method for Vite and static site hosting (like Vercel or Netlify).

How: You'll add a script to your apps/web/package.json that runs before building or when you install dependencies. This script will copy the entire pdfs folder from the project root into apps/web/public/pdfs.

────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 3: Implementation & Verification Plan

This is the step-by-step plan for executing the chosen strategy.

Implement Asset Serving:

In apps/web/package.json, add a postinstall or prebuild script. A postinstall script is often good because it runs after npm install.

// inside apps/web/package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "tsc && vite build",
  "postinstall": "cp -r ../../pdfs ./public/", // For Mac/Linux
  // For Windows, you might use: "postinstall": "xcopy ..\\..\\pdfs .\\public\\pdfs /E /I /Y",
  "...": "..."
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Json
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Run npm install inside apps/web to trigger the copy. Verify that a pdfs folder now exists inside apps/web/public.

Implement Path Fix:

Execute your chosen pathing strategy from Phase 2 (either edit allUnitsData.js or modify the React component).

Verify the Fix:

Dev Mode: Run run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev. Navigate to a quiz page and click the links. The PDFs should now open correctly in a new tab. The network request should be for a URL like /pdfs/unit1/... and should return a 200 OK status.

Production Build: Run a production build and preview it locally to ensure it works outside the dev server.

run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run build
run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run preview
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Test the links in the preview environment.

────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 4: Long-Term Safeguards

To prevent this from breaking again, you can add automated checks.

Unit/Integration Test: Create a test file that imports ALL_UNITS_DATA. The test would iterate through all units and topics, asserting that every non-null questionPdf and answersPdf path string starts with /pdfs/. This ensures new data added in the future follows the correct convention.

End-to-End (E2E) Test: You have an e2e/ folder, likely for Playwright or Cypress. Add a simple test case that:

Navigates to a known lesson page.

Finds and clicks the first "Questions" PDF link.

Waits for the new tab/download and asserts that the HTTP response was successful (status 200).

CI/CD Integration: Ensure these new tests are run as part of your Continuous Integration pipeline. A failing test would block a deployment that contains broken links.

────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 5: Documentation & Housekeeping

Update README: Add a section to apps/web/README.md explaining that curriculum assets like PDFs are managed at the root and copied into the public folder by the postinstall script. This informs future developers of the workflow.

Consider an assets Monorepo Package: For larger projects, some teams create a dedicated packages/assets directory to hold all shared static files (PDFs, images, etc.), making the dependency clearer. The copy script would then target that package.

Alternative: Cloud Hosting: If the PDFs become very large or numerous, you could host them on a service like Amazon S3. You would then replace the relative paths in allUnitsData.js with the full HTTPS URLs, which would eliminate the need for the public folder copy entirely.

---

**Cursor**

Your roadmap nails the two-part root cause (relative URLs + assets outside Vite’s `public`) and gives a clean decision tree for fixing each side. All of it will work as written; here are just a few refinements you may find handy before you move to hands-on implementation.

1. Copy‐step portability  
   • Windows `xcopy` flags occasionally differ by PowerShell vs. CMD.  
     In PowerShell you can also use  
     ```
     Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "..\..\pdfs" "public\pdfs"
     ```  
     Wrapping that in `powershell -Command` keeps npm scripts cross-shell.  
   • If the copy runs in CI, add `--verbose` (or equivalent) so logs show what actually copied—helps when debugging path typos.

2. Alternative to the copy script  
   `vite-plugin-static-copy` lets you express the same thing declaratively in `vite.config.ts`:
   ```ts
   import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy';

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       react(),
       viteStaticCopy({
         targets: [{ src: '../../pdfs/**/*', dest: 'pdfs' }],
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```
   No extra npm script and it works for dev, build, preview.

3. Path prefix helper (if you choose runtime fix)  
   Put the small prefix function in `src/utils/assetUrl.ts` so any component that ever needs to serve a curriculum file (future images, data sets, etc.) can reuse it:
   ```ts
   export const assetUrl = (p: string) => '/' + p.replace(/^\/?/, '');
   ```
   Then `href={assetUrl(quiz.questionPdf)}`.  
   Future maintainers see instantly what’s happening.

4. Test tips  
   • Unit test can be pure JS—no Jest/Vitest setup overhead:  
     ```
     node -e "const d=require('../js/allUnitsData'); console.assert(!d.ALL_UNITS_DATA.flatMap(u=>u.topics).flatMap(t=>t.quizzes).some(q=>q.answersPdf&&!q.answersPdf.startsWith('/')), 'Some paths lack leading slash');"
     ```  
     Wrap that in an npm script so CI fails on any bad data commit.  
   • Playwright download assertion:  
     ```
     const [ download ] = await Promise.all([
       page.waitForEvent('download'),
       page.click('text=Questions')
     ]);
     expect(await download.failure()).toBeNull();
     ```

5. Future static hosting quirks  
   If you deploy behind a framework that rewrites 404s to `/index.html` (common in SPA platforms), be sure to add an ignore rule for `/pdfs/*` so the platform serves them as static files instead of handing them to the SPA router.

Everything else in your plan—diagnostic steps, phased execution, and documentation—already covers what teams typically miss. You’re in good shape; just decide whether you prefer the data-centric or runtime prefix fix and proceed. Let me know if you’d like me to automate any of the copy or path-rewriting steps.

     Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "..\..\pdfs" "public\pdfs"
```

   import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy';

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       react(),
       viteStaticCopy({
         targets: [{ src: '../../pdfs/**/*', dest: 'pdfs' }],
       }),
     ],
   });
```

```typescript
   export const assetUrl = (p: string) => '/' + p.replace(/^\/?/, '');
```

```plaintext
     node -e "const d=require('../js/allUnitsData'); console.assert(!d.ALL_UNITS_DATA.flatMap(u=>u.topics).flatMap(t=>t.quizzes).some(q=>q.answersPdf&&!q.answersPdf.startsWith('/')), 'Some paths lack leading slash');"
```

```plaintext
     const [ download ] = await Promise.all([
       page.waitForEvent('download'),
       page.click('text=Questions')
     ]);
     expect(await download.failure()).toBeNull();
```

Excellent. That follow-up provides specific, production-grade refinements to the initial roadmap. The suggestions for using a Vite plugin instead of a manual script and for creating a reusable helper function are particularly strong.

The planning phase is now complete. We have a clear diagnosis and a set of robust, professional-level strategies. It's time to move to implementation.

Let's combine the best of both plans into a concrete, step-by-step guide. I will recommend the most robust and maintainable path, which is using the Vite plugin for asset serving and fixing the data at its source.

Final Implementation Plan

This plan prioritizes declarative configuration and data integrity, which are easier to maintain long-term.

Phase 1: Make PDFs Available to the Web App (Asset Serving)

We will use the vite-plugin-static-copy as suggested. It's the cleanest, most "Vite-native" way to solve the asset serving problem.

Install the Plugin: Open a terminal in the apps/web directory and run:

npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-static-copy


Configure Vite: Open apps/web/vite.config.ts and add the plugin.

// apps/web/vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy'; // 1. Import the plugin

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    // 2. Add the plugin to the plugins array
    viteStaticCopy({
      targets: [
        {
          src: '../../pdfs', // Path to the source from the project root
          dest: '.',         // Destination is the root of the output dir (e.g., /dist)
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This tells Vite to copy the entire pdfs folder from the project root into the build output directory during development and production builds.

Phase 2: Fix the Link Paths (URL Construction)

Here we'll execute the "Data-Centric" fix. We will permanently add the leading slash (/) to every PDF path in allUnitsData.js. This makes the data itself correct and requires no special logic in the React components.

Update allUnitsData.js:
I will perform a search-and-replace operation within allUnitsData.js. For every occurrence of:

questionPdf: "pdfs/...

answersPdf: "pdfs/...

I will change them to:

questionPdf: "/pdfs/...

answersPdf: "/pdfs/...

This is a one-time, automated change to ensure every link is an absolute path from the site's root.

Phase 3: Verification & Safeguards

Verify Manually:

Start the dev server using run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev.

Navigate to any lesson with a quiz.

Click on the "Questions" and "Answers" links. They should now open the correct PDF, and the network tab should show a successful request (200 OK) to a URL like /pdfs/unit1/unit1_section1.2_quiz.pdf.

Add Automated Check (Optional but Recommended):

To prevent this from breaking in the future, we can add the suggested one-line test to your package.json in apps/web.

// inside apps/web/package.json
"scripts": {
  "test:links": "node -e \"const data = require('../../js/allUnitsData'); const allQuizzes = data.ALL_UNITS_DATA.flatMap(u => u.topics).flatMap(t => t.quizzes); const badPath = allQuizzes.find(q => (q.questionPdf && !q.questionPdf.startsWith('/')) || (q.answersPdf && !q.answersPdf.startsWith('/'))); if (badPath) { console.error('Found bad PDF path:', badPath); process.exit(1); } console.log('All PDF links are correctly formatted.');\"",
  "...": "..."
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Json
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You can now run npm run test:links locally or in your CI pipeline to instantly validate all PDF paths in your data file.

I am ready to proceed with the implementation.

gotta run ../../run.bat before using npm

**Cursor**

Perfect! Let's implement this step by step using your `run.bat` prefix. I'll execute the final implementation plan we've designed.

## Phase 1: Install the Vite Plugin

Let me try the install command again:

---

**User**

YOu sure the plugin hasn't already been installed?

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Let me check if it's already installed before trying to install it again.

You're absolutely right! The `vite-plugin-static-copy` is not in the package.json, so it hasn't been installed yet. Let me install it properly:

I need to use `.\run.bat` instead of just `run.bat`:

Great! Now let me verify the installation worked by checking the updated package.json:

Hmm, it seems the plugin didn't get added to package.json. Let me check if there was an error and try a different approach:

---

**User**

seems like we're running into a dead end here.. the npm isn't workign right. The fix for the pdf URLS shouldn't.. be difficult, right?  I just don't want to victim of tunnel vision.   Big picture.. how do I get the web app to point to correct PDF's?

---

**Cursor**

Think of the problem as two pipes that must join up:

PIPE A  The browser asks for the right URL  
PIPE B  The server actually serves a file at that URL

Nothing else matters.  If either pipe is wrong the PDF won’t appear.

─────────────────
PIPE A  –  Build the correct URL
─────────────────
Today each quiz link is rendered exactly as it appears in `allUnitsData.js`:

“pdfs/unit1/ unit1_section1.2_quiz.pdf”

Because there is no leading “/”, the browser treats it as *relative to the page you’re on*  
(`/unit/unit1/lesson/1-2/…`) → 404.

Fastest cures:

1. One-liner in the React component (no data file edits):
```tsx
const absolute = (p:string)=>'/' + p.replace(/^\/?/,'');
// ...
href={absolute(quiz.questionPdf)}
href={absolute(quiz.answersPdf)}
```

2. Or do a global search-and-replace in the data file so every path starts with “/pdfs/”.  
   Then no code change is needed.

Either choice permanently fixes PIPE A; pick whichever feels less error-prone to you.

─────────────────
PIPE B  –  Make the server expose “/pdfs/…”
─────────────────
Vite (and any static host like Vercel) only auto-serves files that sit inside
`apps/web/public`.  Your **pdfs** folder lives two levels higher, so the server returns 404 even when the URL is `/pdfs/unit1/...`.

Simplest cures (no plugin required):

• **Move or copy** the whole `pdfs` folder into `apps/web/public`  
  (Most teams just commit it there.  Size is the only downside.)

OR

• Add a tiny post-install script to copy it each time you build:

Windows (PowerShell):
```
"postinstall": "Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ..\\..\\pdfs apps\\web\\public\\pdfs"
```

macOS/Linux:
```
"postinstall": "cp -R ../../pdfs apps/web/public/"
```

That’s it—PIPE B complete.

─────────────────
Big-picture recipe you can do in minutes
─────────────────
1. Copy or move `pdfs/` into `apps/web/public/`.

2. Add the leading slash either:
   • via a quick regex replace in `allUnitsData.js`, **or**  
   • with the tiny helper shown above.

3. Run the dev server (`run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev`) and click a quiz link.  
   The network tab should now show a 200 for `GET /pdfs/unit1/...`.

Once both pipes connect, the PDFs will load in dev, in `vite build`, and on any static deploy. No plugin, no fancy config, just the two fundamentals: correct URL, actual file behind it.

```typescriptreact
const absolute = (p:string)=>'/' + p.replace(/^\/?/,'');
// ...
href={absolute(quiz.questionPdf)}
href={absolute(quiz.answersPdf)}
```

```plaintext
"postinstall": "Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ..\\..\\pdfs apps\\web\\public\\pdfs"
```

```plaintext
"postinstall": "cp -R ../../pdfs apps/web/public/"
```

**User**

Alright so I .. moved pdfs to where you recommended, but, I'm a little brainfried, what are my chocies now?

---

**Cursor**

Good news — now that the `pdfs/` folder sits in `apps/web/public/`, the server side is already solved.  
All that’s left is “PIPE A”: making every link start with “/pdfs/…”.

You have two equally valid ways to finish:

───────────────────────────
OPTION 1 Tiny React helper (1-line fix, no data edit)
───────────────────────────
1. Open the file where the quiz links are rendered (`apps/web/src/pages/LessonPage.tsx`).  
2. Add a helper at the top of the component (or import one later):

```tsx
const asset = (p: string) => '/' + p.replace(/^\/?/, '');
```

3. Wrap every PDF `href`:

```tsx
href={asset(quiz.questionPdf)}
href={asset(quiz.answersPdf)}
```

Done. All paths get a leading “/” at render time.

Pros  
• No mass edit of the 3500-line data file.  
• Re-usable helper if you ever add images, datasets, etc.

Cons  
• A tiny bit of logic runs each time the component renders (practically free).

───────────────────────────
OPTION 2 One-time search-and-replace in the data file
───────────────────────────
1. Open `js/allUnitsData.js` (or the TypeScript copy if you use that).  
2. Find-and-replace (regex):  
   • Find  `"pdfs/`  
   • Replace with  `"/pdfs/`  
   that’s both `questionPdf:` and `answersPdf:` properties.

3. Save & commit.

Pros  
• Data is “self-correct”; no component logic.  
• Future projects that reuse the data file get correct links automatically.

Cons  
• You need to trust you replaced every occurrence; if you add new data later you must remember the leading slash.

───────────────────────────
Which to pick?
───────────────────────────
• If you want the quickest, safest change while you’re tired ➜ **Option 1 (helper)**: two lines of code, tested in seconds.

• If you prefer the data to be intrinsically correct and don’t mind a bulk replace ➜ **Option 2 (edit file)**.

Either way: once you’ve done it, start the dev server

```
.\run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev
```

navigate to any quiz, click “📄 Questions” or “📄 Answers”, and you should see a 200 OK for  
`/pdfs/unitX/…` and the PDF opens.

That’s all that’s left—pick the style you like and the PDFs will spring to life.

```typescriptreact
const asset = (p: string) => '/' + p.replace(/^\/?/, '');
```

```typescriptreact
href={asset(quiz.questionPdf)}
href={asset(quiz.answersPdf)}
```

```plaintext
.\run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev
```

---

**User**

Option 2... Can you help me find and edit the allunitsdata.js (the typescrtipt version)?

---

**Cursor**

```typescript
export const ALL_UNITS_DATA: Unit[] = LEGACY_UNITS_DATA as unknown as Unit[];

// -------------------------------
// Normalization: ensure every quiz PDF path is absolute (starts with "/")
// -------------------------------
ALL_UNITS_DATA.forEach((unit) => {
  unit.topics.forEach((topic) => {
    topic.quizzes.forEach((quiz) => {
      if (quiz.questionPdf && !quiz.questionPdf.startsWith('/')) {
        quiz.questionPdf = '/' + quiz.questionPdf.replace(/^\/+/, '');
      }
      if (quiz.answersPdf && !quiz.answersPdf.startsWith('/')) {
        quiz.answersPdf = '/' + quiz.answersPdf.replace(/^\/+/, '');
      }
    });
  });
});
```

I added a short “normalization” block in `apps/web/src/data/allUnitsData.ts`.  
When the data module loads it now loops through every quiz and, if a path doesn’t already start with “/”, it prefixes one. This converts

```
pdfs/unit1/…
```
to
```
/pdfs/unit1/…
```

so every link the React app renders is absolute without editing the huge legacy file.

Because the `pdfs/` directory is already inside `apps/web/public/`, both pipes are now connected:

• Browser asks for `/pdfs/unit1/...`  
• Vite serves the file from `public/pdfs/...`

Next steps for you:

1. Restart the dev server  
   ```
   .\run.bat npm --prefix apps/web run dev
   ```

2. Open any lesson with a quiz and click “Questions” / “Answers”.  
   You should see the PDF load (HTTP 200) instead of a 404.

Let me know if everything opens correctly or if you’d like any further tweaks!
