Of course. This is the perfect time to consolidate everything into a single, authoritative document. It will serve as our map, showing the terrain we've covered, our precise location, and the paths that lie ahead.

Here is the cogent roadmap of our project.

### **Project Roadmap: APStat Park Refactor**
*As of: 6/11/2025*

#### **I. Executive Summary**

We have successfully executed a multiphase modernization of the APStat Park project, transforming it from a static-file prototype into a robust, interactive, and maintainable Single-Page Application (SPA). The core architecture is now stable, with a TypeScript backend and a React frontend operating in a managed monorepo.

**Current Position:** We are approximately **90% complete with Phase 2 (Core User Experience)**. The most complex features‚Äîgranular progress tracking, time-based pacing, and bookmarking‚Äîare fully implemented and functional. We are about to begin the final module of this phase, which focuses on polish and gamification.

#### **II. Guiding Principles & Key Learnings**

Our journey has revealed several critical considerations that now guide our development philosophy:

1.  **Embrace the Environment, Don't Fight It:** Our primary technical hurdle was the locked-down Windows environment with portable Node.js. Instead of continued friction, we developed the `run.bat` wrapper, a stable solution that allows us to work efficiently within the given constraints.
2.  **Stability Through Structure:** The initial goal was stability. The conversion to a fully-typed TypeScript API and a component-based React UI has been the single most significant step toward this, making the codebase easier to reason about, debug, and extend.
3.  **Decoupled Development is Key:** The API's in-memory fallback for the database proved invaluable. It allowed us to build and test the entire frontend UI without needing a constant, live database connection, dramatically speeding up development.
4.  **Pragmatism for V1:** We have consciously deferred complex, lower-priority tasks (like migrating `allUnitsData.ts` to the database) in favor of delivering a complete, high-value user experience first.
5.  **Deliver Features, Then Harden:** We prioritized completing the full user-facing feature set of Phase 2 before moving to "production-readiness" tasks like testing and CI/CD. This ensures we have a valuable product to stabilize, rather than a perfectly-tested but incomplete one.

#### **III. The Phased Implementation Plan**

##### **Phase 0: Foundation & Safety Net**
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete**
*   **Goal:** Establish a modern, stable development environment.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Monorepo setup using `npm` workspaces (`apps/api`, `apps/web`).
    *   Integrated standard tooling: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier.
    *   Solved the core dependency installation and PATH issues with the `run.bat` script.
*   **Considerations:** This phase was unexpectedly complex due to the environment but establishing the `run.bat` solution was the key that unlocked all subsequent progress.

##### **Phase 1: Backend Modernization**
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete**
*   **Goal:** Convert the API to be robust, type-safe, and ready for new features.
*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Full conversion of the Express API from JavaScript to strict TypeScript.
    *   Defined clear, typed interfaces for all data models (Progress, Bookmark, etc.).
    *   Implemented the granular progress data model (`videos_watched`, `quizzes_completed` arrays).
    *   The `progress/sync` endpoint was updated to handle both granular and legacy updates.
    *   Established the critical database-to-in-memory fallback system.
*   **Considerations:** Successfully debugging the public vs. internal Railway database URL was a key learning for deployment.

##### **Phase 2: Core User Experience**
*   **Status:** üöß **In Progress (~90%)**
*   **Goal:** Build a fully interactive and engaging frontend application.
*   **Accomplishments (Modules 1 & 2):**
    *   **User Identity & Navigation:** Implemented the `AuthContext` for a stable login/navigation flow.
    *   **Time & Pace Tracking:** Built the `timeTracking.ts` utility and integrated the `<PaceTracker />` component on the dashboard.
    *   **Granular Progress UI:** Replaced lesson-level completion with per-item "Mark as Watched/Complete" buttons, providing immediate user feedback.
    *   **Bookmarking System:** Implemented the `BookmarkContext` and a full-stack bookmarking feature, from the üìå buttons to the global ‚≠ê "return" button.
*   **Remaining Work (Module 3):**
    *   ‚ö™Ô∏è **Implement the Leaderboard:** Create the `GET /api/leaderboard` endpoint and the corresponding frontend page.
    *   ‚ö™Ô∏è **Implement a Real-Time Sync Indicator:** Use WebSocket events to show a small toast when progress is updated from another device.

##### **Phase 3: Production Readiness & Hardening**
*   **Status:** ‚ö™Ô∏è **To Do**
*   **Goal:** Lock in the application's stability and make it deployable with confidence.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Testing Suite:** Add Unit (Vitest), Component (React Testing Library), and End-to-End (Playwright) tests.
    *   **Observability:** Implement structured logging (e.g., Winston) and error reporting (e.g., Sentry).
    *   **Database Migrations:** Evolve the schema from startup scripts to a formal migration system (`knex`, `drizzle-kit`).

##### **Phase 4: Future Expansion**
*   **Status:** ‚ö™Ô∏è **To Do (Post-V1)**
*   **Goal:** Add major new capabilities to the platform.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Content Management System:** Move `allUnitsData` to the database and build a simple admin UI for content editing.
    *   **Real Authentication:** Integrate a third-party auth provider for persistent user accounts.

#### **IV. Our Current Position & Immediate Next Steps**

We are at a clear and exciting junction: the final module of **Phase 2**.

The immediate task is to **Implement the Leaderboard**, which will bring the core feature set to 100% completion.

1.  **Backend:** Add the `GET /api/leaderboard` endpoint to query and return the top users.
2.  **Frontend:** Build the `/leaderboard` page in React to fetch and display this data.

Completing this will deliver a fully-featured "Version 1.0" of the application experience, perfectly positioning us to then begin **Phase 3: Production Readiness**.
