Action Plan for Implementing GitHub Actions CI Workflow
Objective
Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically validate the codebase on every push and pull request to the main branch.
Actionable Steps
Step 1: Create Workflow Directory & File

Why: Set up the structure for the CI workflow.
Action: Create directory .github/workflows/ and file ci.yml.

Step 2: Define the Workflow

Why: Configure the CI pipeline to run linting, tests, and build on a neutral server.
Action: Add the following YAML content to .github/workflows/ci.yml.
Code:name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [ '20.x' ]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build



Next Steps

Create .github/workflows/ci.yml and add the YAML content.
Commit and push changes to the GitHub repository.
Check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repo to verify the "Node.js CI" workflow runs.
Monitor CI pipeline to ensure linting, tests, and build pass on future pushes/pull requests.
